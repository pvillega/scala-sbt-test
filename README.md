* http://www.scalastyle.org/ (to check possible Scala issues)
* http://www.scalatest.org/
* http://www.scalactic.org/ (for handy additional methods)
* https://github.com/sbt/sbt-unidoc (to generate scala docs across projects)
* https://github.com/rtimush/sbt-updates (to check for new versions of libraries)
